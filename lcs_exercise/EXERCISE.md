    * Created **custom components** off the MUI component library. 
    * Introduce a **button** to enable sorting of the members list by name.

If you have the .NET SDK and Yarn installed locally, you can start the components in two different shells with:

```
$ cd api
$ dotnet watch run
```
and
```
$ cd frontend
$ yarn install
$ yarn dev
```
For the ```frontend```: ```yarn install``` **important step: added a new UI library**
